# Election Audit Analysis

# Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this election audit was to give the election commission more information about how the county turnout and how they were voting. This is important information, not just as it relates to elections. Knowing the voter turnout and the way a county voter base behaves has far reaching financial, and social applications.

# Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
 - There were 369,711 total votes cast in this election. We were able to calculate this by first initializing a variable that we called 'total_votes' which we gave a value of zero. This variable is called an accumulator and we give it a value of zero to start because we want the variable to iterate through the rows of data and add 1 every time it goes through a row or 'vote'. We get our variable to iterate through the rows by first reading the headers, and then iterating through the rows by adding a value of 1 each time it passes a row. ![total_votes_code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82848585/118405810-7d891080-b647-11eb-9c11-26538c9d50fa.png)
